# Codebase Explorer

Intelligent codebase analysis to understand structure and find relevant code.

## Capabilities

- **Structure Overview** - Directory tree with key file identification
- **Pattern Search** - Find files by name patterns or content
- **Import Analysis** - Trace dependencies and exports
- **Tech Stack Detection** - Identify frameworks and libraries

## Instructions

When invoked:
1. For Structure Overview:
   - Generate directory tree (depth 3)
   - Identify entry points (main, index, app)
   - List key configuration files
   - Detect tech stack

2. For Find Related Files:
   - Ask for keyword/pattern
   - Search with Glob and Grep
   - Rank results by relevance
   - Show code snippets

3. For Dependency Analysis:
   - Select starting file
   - Trace imports recursively
   - Generate dependency graph
   - Identify circular dependencies
