## How Commands Work

Each `.md` file in this directory is a slash command. When you type `/command-name` in Claude Code CLI, Claude reads the corresponding `.md` file and follows the instructions.

### Command Structure

```markdown
---
description: Brief description shown in command list
options:
  - label: "Option 1"
    description: "What this option does"
---

# Command Title

Instructions for Claude to follow when this command is invoked.
```

## Creating Custom Commands

1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Add YAML frontmatter with description
3. Write instructions for Claude to follow
4. The command name is the filename (without .md)

## Reinstalling

To reinstall or update commands:

```bash
npx claude-cli-advanced-starter-pack init --force
```
