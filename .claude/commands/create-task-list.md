# Intelligent Task List Generator

Create a comprehensive task list with codebase exploration, clarifying questions, and GitHub integration.

## Features

- **Codebase Exploration** - Deploy agents to understand relevant files and patterns
- **Clarifying Questions** - Ask follow-up questions when context is insufficient
- **Testing Options** - Ralph Loop, ngrok/production, Playwright modes
- **GitHub Integration** - Optionally create a tracked GitHub issue for the task
- **Progress Hook** - Auto-update GitHub issue as tasks complete

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Capture User Prompt

If no arguments provided, ask what the user wants to accomplish.

### Step 2: Context Assessment

Evaluate the prompt for specificity, scope, technical depth, and reproducibility.

**Score Calculation**:
- 70-100%: Sufficient context -> Parallel exploration
- 0-69%: Insufficient context -> Quick scan + clarifying questions

### Step 3: Deploy Exploration Agents

Deploy in parallel:
- **Explore Agent 1**: Find files related to the task
- **Explore Agent 2**: Search for tests and documentation
- **Explore Agent 3** (if backend): Find API endpoints and models

### Step 4: Synthesize and Ask Questions

Present findings and ask mandatory questions:

1. **Testing Approach**: Ralph Loop vs Manual vs Minimal
2. **Playwright Environment**: ngrok vs production vs none
3. **GitHub Integration** (NEW): Create tracked GitHub issue?
4. **Confirm Plan**: Proceed or adjust?

### Step 5: Create Task List

Use TodoWrite to build the task list with:
- Task 0: Persistent context (never marked complete)
- Task 1: Login via Playwright (if E2E testing)
- Tasks 2-N: Implementation tasks
- Final tasks: Verification and commit

### Step 6: Create GitHub Issue (Optional)

If user selected GitHub integration:
1. Create comprehensive issue with codebase analysis
2. Add to project board
3. Install progress hook to auto-update issue

## GitHub Integration Details

When enabled, the command:
1. Creates a GitHub issue with:
   - Problem statement from user prompt
   - Code analysis from exploration
   - Task checklist (matching TodoWrite tasks)
   - Reference documentation links

2. Installs a PostToolUse hook that:
   - Watches for TodoWrite calls
   - Updates GitHub issue progress when tasks complete
   - Adds comments for significant milestones

## Instructions

When invoked:
1. Gather task description (from args or by asking)
2. Assess context quality
3. Deploy exploration agents (parallel if sufficient context)
4. Present findings and ask questions
5. Create task list with TodoWrite
6. Optionally create GitHub issue and install progress hook
7. Begin Task 1
